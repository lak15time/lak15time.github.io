# It's About Time: 4th International Workshop on Temporal Analyses of Learning Data

## Overview

Learning occurs over time and interest in analyses that probe temporal aspects continues to grow as a powerful way to understand the processes through which learning occurs. The study of common and consequential sequences of events (such as learners accessing resources, interacting with other learners and engaging in self-regulatory activities) and how these associate with learning outcomes, as well as the ways in which knowledge and skills grow or evolve over time are both core areas of interest. However, the emerging area of temporal analysis presents both technical and theoretical challenges in appropriating suitable techniques and interpreting results in the context of learning. The learning analytics community offers a productive focal ground for exploring and furthering efforts to address these challenges as it is already positioned in the "middle space" where learning and analytic concerns meet. In addition, learning analytics datasets are replete with fine-grained temporal data: click streams; chat logs; document edit histories (e.g. wikis, etherpads); motion tracking (e.g. eye-tracking, Microsoft Kinect), and so on. This workshop, the fourth in a series on temporal analysis of learning data, provides a focal point for analytics researchers to consider the larger issues of and approaches to temporality in learning analytics. The focus is on the particular opportunities and challenges of temporal analysis for learning analytics and how learning analytics data, methods and approaches can inform the larger community working with temporal analyses of learning data.

## Workshop Schedule

March 16, 2015, 8:30am - 12:30pm

- 8:30 - 9:00 - Introduction to the Workshop: Temporal Analyses and Learning Analytics (led by organizers)
- 9:00 - 10:00 - Group Work Session 1 (Conceptual): Intro to the Approach, Tools & Data Types it can work for (analytic & data presenters)
- 10:00 - 10:15 - Coffee Break
- 10:15 - 11:45 - Group Work Session 2 (Application): Hands-on putting data into the tools and/or critical discussion of its application to specific data sets (all group members)
- 11:45 - 12:30 - Group Share Out, General Discussion and Wrap-Up (whole workshop)

## Participation

Those interested in participating are invited to submit short (1 page maximum) applications for one of the following roles briefly describing which role you would like to participate in at the workshop and what you bring to the position (e.g., past experience working with temporal analyses, how this area relates to your research interests). Those proposing a conceptual, data, or analytic presentation should also briefly outline what they would like to present on -- i.e., conceptual issues addressed / characteristics of the data set and if any, analyses conducted thus far / analytic approach and what data it is suitable for. Participation roles include the following:

- **Conceptual presenters**: those who submit short conceptual papers on temporality for discussion at the workshop

- **Data presenters**: those who provide a salient dataset for discussion of its temporal properties and potential analyses

- **Analytic presenters**: those who provide an analytic technique relevant to temporal analysis

- **Commentators**: those who commit to reading, and responding to, at least one of the above kinds of submission -- note that we welcome commentators with all backgrounds and levels of experience

Applications to participate should be emailed to [Simon Knight](mailto:sjgknight@gmail.com) with the subject line ‘LAKTime’ by **January 11th**.

We aim to send out notifications on January 16th, before LAK's earlybird registration deadline (Jan 21st).

## Important Dates

- January 11th: Deadline for short LAKTime applications to sjgknight@gmail.com
- January 16th: Notifications sent out
- January 21st: LAK15's earlybird registration deadline (conference deadline)
- March 16-20th: LAK15 Conference

## Format

Discussion on the day will include breakout groups with members from the different roles, including commentators for each group. This design aims to facilitate an inclusive and effective discussion on the day, and onwards. Prior to the day some core themes and questions will be identified for discussion. Participants will be accepted on the basis of contribution to the theme, with a desire to move forward both methodological and conceptual work in the area. We anticipate the theme bringing new people into the learning analytics community, nurturing connections and developing the theme within the community.
