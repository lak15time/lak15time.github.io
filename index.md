tagline: 4th International Workshop on Temporal Analyses of Learning Data

{% include JB/setup %}

## Overview

Learning occurs over time and interest in analyses that probe temporal aspects continues to grow as a powerful way to understand the processes through which learning occurs. The study of common and consequential sequences of events (such as learners accessing resources, interacting with other learners and engaging in self-regulatory activities) and how these associate with learning outcomes, as well as the ways in which knowledge and skills grow or evolve over time are both core areas of interest. However, the emerging area of temporal analysis presents both technical and theoretical challenges in appropriating suitable techniques and interpreting results in the context of learning. The learning analytics community offers a productive focal ground for exploring and furthering efforts to address these challenges as it is already positioned in the “‘middle space’ where learning and analytic concerns meet. In addition learning analytics datasets are replete with fine-grained temporal data: click streams; chat logs; document edit histories (e.g. wikis, etherpads); motion tracking (e.g. eye-tracking, Microsoft Kinect), and so on. This workshop, the fourth in a series on temporal analysis of learning data, provides a focal point for analytics researchers to consider the larger issues of and approaches to temporality in learning analytics. The focus is on the particular opportunities and challenges of temporal analysis for learning analytics and how learning analytics data, methods and approaches can inform the larger community working with temporal analyses of learning data.

## Participation

Those interested in participating are invited to submit short (1 page max) applications for one of the following roles briefly describing which role you would like to participate in at the workshop and what you bring to the position (past experience working with temporal analyses or how this area relates to your research interests). Those proposing a conceptual, data, or analytic presentation should also briefly outline what they would like to present on - i.e. conceptual issues addressed / characteristics of the data set and if any, analyses conducted thus far / analytic approach and what data it is suitable for:

- Conceptual presenters -- those who submit short conceptual papers on temporality for discussion at the workshop

- Data presenters -- those who provide a salient dataset for discussion of its temporal properties and potential analyses

- Analytic presenters -- those who provide an analytic technique relevant to temporal analysis

- Commentators -- those who commit to reading, and responding to, at least one of the above kinds of submission -- note that we welcome commentators with all backgrounds and levels of experience

Short applications to participate should be emailed to sjgknight@gmail.com with the subject line ‘LAKTime’ by January 11th

We aim to send out notifications on January 16th, before the earlybird deadline (Jan 21st)

## Important Dates

- January 11th deadline for short LAKTime applications to sjgknight@gmail.com
- January 16th notifications sent out
- January 21st earlybird deadline (conference deadline)
- March 16-20th LAK15 Conference

## Organizers

- Simon Knight, Open University
- Alyssa F. Wise, Simon Fraser University
- Bodong Chen, University of Minnesota
- Britte Haugan Cheng, SRI International

## Format




Discussion on the day will include breakout groups with members from the different roles, including commentators for each group. This design aims to facilitate an inclusive and effective discussion on the day, and onwards. Prior to the day some core themes and questions will be identified for discussion. Participants will be accepted on the basis of contribution to the theme, with a desire to move forward both methodological and conceptual work in the area. We anticipate the theme bringing new people into the learning analytics community, nurturing connections and developing the theme within the community.

Participants will be invited to submit, via a call for participation, in a number of roles including:
-    Conceptual presenters  -- those who submit short conceptual papers on temporality for discussion at the workshop
-    Data presenters -- those who provide a salient dataset  for discussion of its temporal properties and potential analyses
-    Analytic presenters -- those who provide an analytic technique relevant to temporal analysis
-    Commentators -- those who commit to reading, and responding to, at least one of the above kinds of submission

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:

    title : My Blog =)

    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.

## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
